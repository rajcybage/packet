Packet is a library for writing networking applications in Ruby.
It follows Evented Model of network programming and implements almost all the
features provided by EventMachine.

It also provides real UNIX workers for concurrent programming. Each worker has 
reactor loop of its own and getting long running tasks done in workers is easy.
