* DONE Need to implement a callback mechanism.
* TODO Need to write a method of connecting to external servers as clients and feeding
  that to eventloop.
* TODO Need to figure out a way to invoke callbacks, and let workers handle the
  incoming data and requests.
* TODO Not very clear about organisation of workers.
* TODO A way to allow other threads to run, while main event loop is running using Thread.pass thingy.
* TODO Need to detect disconnection and reconnection of client connections.
* DONE Use CPU worker to calculate 10+20 and return the result to client.
* TODO Implement connection from workers.
* TODO Implement io workers properly.
* TODO Implement outgoing connections from master process properly.
* TODO Implement tcp socket no_delay everywhere for faster access to data.
* TODO Data passed to workers could be anything.
* TODO Lots of code duplication between worker and packet files because nature of functions these two are
  using is somewhat similar.
