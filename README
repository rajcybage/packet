Swat is a todo list manager for Gnome & Emacs.

Heck : Emacs?

Yeah : In fact, swat just displays your tasks in red, blue and green. But you can't edit your tasks
     in swat. For editing your tasks, you must fire your faithful Emacs and use org mode for editing
     tasks.

Swat : View tasks, view tasks by priority, sync using svn and ftp and all that sick things. 
     Press Alt-F11 twice, to see the list.
